# SocketFileTransfer

In the current version you need to run the FTPServerSide.java separately from FTPClietSide.java, but at the same machine!
There are two default paths need to be created before running the app:

1) C:\clientRepo
2) C:\serverRepo\exampleFile.txt

exampleFile.txt is the one for which the client sends a request to the server to dowload it.

finally, there are two predefined ports for UDP port on server (4000) and TCP port on client (2000)
